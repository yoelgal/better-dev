# /graphify-wrapper-map

Turn a sprawling repo into a small, deliberate set of domains. The goal is
**focus** - index the few subtrees the operator will actually query, not the
whole tree. Flow: discover → propose → refine → register.

```bash
. .better-dev/bin/bd-gfx 2>/dev/null || . "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/bd-gfx"
reg=$(gfx_registry)
[ -f "$reg" ] || { echo "run /graphify-wrapper-setup first"; exit 1; }
root=$(gfx_this_worktree)
```

## 1. Discover

Drill into any parent dir (`services/`, `apps/`, `packages/`, `cmd/`, `libs/`)
that holds multiple independent units.

```bash
cd "$root"
echo "## build roots (dependency boundaries)"
find . -maxdepth 4 \( -name go.mod -o -name package.json -o -name pyproject.toml \
    -o -name pubspec.yaml -o -name Cargo.toml -o -name pom.xml -o -name build.gradle \) \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/vendor/*' \
  | sed 's#^\./##' | sort

echo "## top-level dirs: tracked files + dominant language"
for d in $(git ls-files | awk -F/ 'NF>1{print $1}' | sort -u); do
  n=$(git ls-files "$d" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  ext=$(git ls-files "$d" | sed -n 's/.*\.//p' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1 \
        | awk '{print $2" ("$1")"}')
  printf '%7s  %-26s  %s\n' "$n" "$d" "$ext"
done

echo "## already registered (skip / refine these)"
gfx_index_names
```

Size a candidate path with `git ls-files <path> | wc -l` and sample its
languages before proposing.

## 2. Propose

**≤ ~6 coherent domains**, each a single repo-relative subtree (graphify indexes
one path per graph). Group by stack or bounded context (e.g. `backend`,
`frontend`, `mobile`, `protos`, `infra`).

Present a table:

| domain | path | files | language | semantic? | why |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | -------- | --------- | --- |

Rules for the proposal:

- Recommend `semantic: true` **only** for domains the operator will ask
  architecture questions about - it costs serial `sonnet` calls per chunk
  (`claude-cli`). Everything else stays AST-only (free).
- Explicitly list what you're **leaving unindexed** and why (vendored deps,
  generated code, build output, docs, fixtures).
- Flag overlaps/nesting: two domains must not nest (a parent path's graph would
  re-cover the child). If they do, pick one granularity.
- If a logical domain spans multiple disjoint subtrees, either pick their common
  ancestor or split into two named domains - note the tradeoff.

## 3. Refine (interactive)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the set and collect edits. Offer the operator
the obvious levers: keep / merge two / split one / rename / change a path / drop
/ toggle semantic. Do **not** touch the registry before approval.

## 4. Register

Upsert each approved domain. One path per index.

```bash
# repeat per approved domain (name, path, sem in {true,false}):
tmp=$(mktemp)
jq --arg n "$name" --arg p "$path" --argjson s "$sem" \
   '.indexes[$n]={path:$p, semantic:$s}' "$reg" > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" "$reg"
```

```bash
echo "registered domains:"; jq '.indexes' "$reg"
```

## 5. Next

Point the operator at `/graphify-wrapper-sync` to build all registered domains
(AST, plus semantic where marked), or `/graphify-wrapper-sync <name>` for one.
For a large first domain, suggest an AST-only sync to gauge build time before a
`--semantic` pass.
